 <h1><b>My Favourite Places To Go To </b></h1>

  <p>My <i>favourite</i> city in England is London. I feel at home with the stylish resturants, the groovy bars, and the busy and bustling nightlife of the beautiful city. The best resturant I've been to so far is <a class="fact_link" href="https://sexyfish.com/private-dining/.html" target="blank"> Sexy Fish in Mayfair. </a></p>
	<p>Below is a picture of the resturant, as well as a picture of me during my first visit there for my birthday.<p>
		<p>Believe it or not, we had fish!<p>

	<H1>As anyone who knows me will tell you, I am <i>obsessed</i> with Italian food, and my favourite go-to meal is a creamy, mushroom pasta dish, that looks something like this!</h1>

	<p>Despite having very little free time due to a hectic uni schedule and lots of work to do, one of favourite hobbies to do in my free time is music. I enjoy singing, and playing the guitar and piano. You can find a picture of my favourite <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.sonovente.com/en-gb/fender-deluxe-stratocaster-pf-hss-candy-apple-red-p56150.html" target="blank"> guitar here.</a></p>

	<p>Below you can see a <i>lovely</i> picture of one of my house mates and I in our new house in Oxford.</p>
	<p>We'd just finished decorating our the rooms, and had a glass of our favourite Tesco's saver wine to celebrate.</span>

	<p>Despite only just being 5'4, and appearing fragile and delicate most of the time, I am actually very sport obsessed, and enjoy running, going to the gym, and hockey. Before Covid put everyone's plans on hold, I was due to run the October 2020 Oxford Half Marathon to raise money for cancer awareness. <b>Clicking on the cancer resarch logo picture above will take you to their page, where you can make a small donation or contribution to the charity!</b></span></p>

<h2> About Me As A Person</h2>
	<p class="fact">	<p class="fact"> I like to think of myself as kind, thoughtul, and generous. During the Christmas period I often like to go to the local hospital and donate presents that I have bought for the children, such as colouring books, teddy bears, and jigsaw puzzles. Despite losing my weekend job due to coronavirus, I still hope to save enough money to be able do the donating again this year. </p.</span></p>

	<p class="fact">A challenge I am currently facing is the stress brought about by coronavirus. Some of my family members are vulerable, meaning I an't go home to see them incase i am carrying the virus and could potentially infect them. This means that I haven't been home to see them since I moved into my uni house on July 31st, even though they only live an hour away, whcih I am finding very difficult as I am someone who is usually very close to my family.</span></p>
