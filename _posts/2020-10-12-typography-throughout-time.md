In the last 60 years, from the premiere of the iconic Sound of Music, to the more modern James Bond, typography styles in films have changed significantly. In the late 1960's, when both Breakfast At Tiffany's and the Sound of Music were produced, the hand-written style of typography, such as the font called "Engravers" was particularly popular. In the below article I am going to be analysing the way in which typography has changed since then, and the possible reasons behind this.

When looking at film posters and the opening scenes from films produced in the late 60's, such as Breakfast at Tiffany's, it is clear to see how a very relaxed, handwritten and welcoming typography was used back in the time period. However, when comparing this font choice to more recent films, the typography in the more modern ones, such as the 007 James Bond movie, they often appears more processed and manufactured, unlike the authentic, traditional style from films in the 60's.

**Typography in the 1960's**

As seen in the example below of The Sound of Music typography, the font appears very genuine and handwritten. The exact font used is called " X" When analysing this type of typography, it can be presumed that the purpose of using a typography like this is to create a sense of familiarity and comfort for audience, making them recognise the authentic style of the typography, and therefore automatically view the film as a down to earth, iconic family classic. 





**Typography in the Present Day**

However, when comparing the typography to a film from the present day, such as one of James bond's films, it is immediately obvious that there are several differences between the two era's typography's, and this allows us to explore the way in which typography has developed and changed over the years. As seen in the examples below, the typography choices for the Spectre film are very modern, almost appearing as if they have been edited and digitally constructed on a computer. The exact font is called "X". This type of typogrphy has the effect of .........

**Overall Comparison and Analysis**

When looking at the typography from the two different time periods, there is no doubt that typography has expanded and grown massively in the space of the past 60 years. Whereas handwritten,  more authentic looking fonts used to be used in order to make the audience comfortable and recognise the familiarity of the film, more niche, quirky styles of typography are now being used in the 21st century, in order to keep up with the ever evolving times, and keep audiences more engaged and involved in newer, more dynamic styles of films.
