The creation of films in colour, as opposed to black and white, was a very significant turning point in the world of artistic creation/

Up until the early 1950's, television entertainment was solely in black and white. In this next blog post, I will be analysing and comparing the way in which typography and calligraphy differ when used in black and white films, as opposed to films in colour. I will do this by analysing the movie poster for the film A Streetcar Named Desire, to two very colourful and vibrant movie adverts, Mamma Mia and The Holiday.
